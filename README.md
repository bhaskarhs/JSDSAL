# JSDSAL

The data of localStorage is persistent, as long as we do not actively clear it, it will always exist.
Closing a tab/window ends the session and clears objects in sessionStorage.
Question 2: “Can localStorage share data under the same website?”

My friend: “This is another easy one! Data can be shared between different tabs or windows under the same website”
You are great, I want to test you one more question, Can sessionStorage share data between multiple tabs”

My friend: “No, each window or tab has a separate sessionStorage, there is no data sharing between them”
